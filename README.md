This repository contains the code to develop a measure for the commercial potential of science, following Masclans, Hasan, and Cohen, 2024. 

The repository includes code for training models and generating predictions within containerized environments. This approach is particularly beneficial for handling large datasets or training multiple models simultaneously.

For users who find container management challenging, we've also provided a simplified notebook version that can be easily used, for instance, via Google Colab.
